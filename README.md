## Description
Is it emo is a silly project that utilizes the Spotify API, Akashrchandran's lyric API, and the OpenAI GPT API to rank songs by how emo they are. 

This project was built for fun/educational purposes, so there are a few important notes if you'd like to fork this project.

1) You will need to copy in a valid Spotify passkey as well as an OpenAI API key for the project to work.
2) You should not deploy the project as is to a live server as all the logic is on the client side and will expose your API keys.
3) You can easily reskin this project changing the prompt in the askAI function in the script.js file.


## Credits
- I based the data visualization on [Peyman's "Pure CSS Circular Progress" on CodePen](https://codepen.io/pfndesign/pen/eYpONdx).
- I used [Akashrchandran's Spotify Lyrics API](https://github.com/akashrchandran/spotify-lyrics-api) to fetch the lyrics.

## Link to Deployed Application
At the moment I have no plans to deploy this application as OpenAI API credits can be expensive. If you're interested in supporting the project, send me a note at ericallenlake@gmail.com
